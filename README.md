## 🔥 Plan of Action
1. **Daily Practice:** Solve 2-3 problems daily, covering a mix of easy, medium, and hard levels.
2. **Mock Interviews:** Use platforms like Pramp, Interviewing.io, or LeetCode's mock interviews.
3. **Revisit Weak Areas:** Identify and focus on weak topics during practice.
4. **Understand Patterns:** Focus on the problem-solving approach, not just memorizing solutions.
